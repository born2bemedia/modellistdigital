            <strong>Collection of Information</strong>: The Modellist Limited

            information for purposes such as processing orders, providing
            customer service, improving our services, and communicating with
            users about their accounts and offerings. We may also use this
            information to send promotional emails about new products, special
            offers, or other information that users may find interesting.

            <strong>Data Security</strong>: We implement reasonable security
            measures to protect the confidentiality and security of users'
            personal information. However, no method of transmission over the
            Internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, so we cannot
            guarantee absolute security.
